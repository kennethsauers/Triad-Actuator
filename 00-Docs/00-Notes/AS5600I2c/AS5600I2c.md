I got the as5600 chip to respond with both 3.3v and 5v feed via the onboard power pins. there was no need for a code change

Note that when the power vin was set to 5v the scl and sda pins were pulled up to 5v

The pins were as follows

| AS5600 Pin | STM32G4 Nucleo Pin |
|------------|--------------------|
| Vin        | 3.3V or 5V         |
| GND        | GND                |
| SCL        | D15 (SCL)          |
| SDA        | D14 (SDA)          |

I did add some wire code to set the i2c pins
