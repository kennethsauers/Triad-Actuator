I got the as5600 chip to respond with both 3.3v and 5v feed via the onboard power pins. there was no need for a code change

Note that when the power vin was set to 5v the scl and sda pins were pulled up to 5v

The pins were as follows

| AS5600 Pin | STM32G4 Nucleo Pin |
|------------|--------------------|
| Vin        | 3.3V or 5V         |
| GND        | GND                |
| SCL        | D15 (SCL)          |
| SDA        | D14 (SDA)          |

I did add some wire code to set the i2c pins


I2c Bus Scan Code
```
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include <AS5600.h>

void runI2cScan()
{
    byte error, address;
    int nDevices;

    Serial.println("Scanning...");

    nDevices = 0;
    for(address = 1; address < 127; address++ )
    {
        // The i2c_scanner uses the return value of
        // the Write.endTransmisstion to see if
        // a device did acknowledge to the address.
        Wire.beginTransmission(address);
        error = Wire.endTransmission();

        if (error == 0)
        {
            Serial.print("I2C device found at address 0x");
            if (address<16)
            Serial.print("0");
            Serial.print(address,HEX);
            Serial.println(" !");

            nDevices++;
        }
        else if (error==4)
        {
            Serial.print("Unknow error at address 0x");
            if (address<16)
            Serial.print("0");
            Serial.println(address,HEX);
        }
    }
    if (nDevices == 0)
        Serial.println("No I2C devices found\n");
    else
        Serial.println("done\n");

}

int i = 0;
void setup() {
  // Setup i2c Wire
  Wire.setSCL(PB8);
  Wire.setSDA(PB9);
  Wire.begin();


  // Setup Serial Interface
  Serial.begin(9600);
  delay(5000);
  Serial.println("Starting Application, end of setup");
}

void loop() {
  runI2cScan();
  delay(5000); // wait 5 seconds for next scan
}



```

I Pulled in a AS5600 Arduino Lib included it and got an example code running using the serial Monitor to print the rotation

There seems to be a problem polling the angle at high rpm, missing steps and therefore getting false readings.
